# AWS-Ec2-Hosting-Linux
To deploy a project from GitHub to an AWS EC2 instance running Ubuntu, you typically need to follow these general steps:

1. **Set up your EC2 instance**: Launch an EC2 instance with Ubuntu as the operating system. Make sure you have SSH access to the instance.

2. **Install necessary software**: Connect to your EC2 instance via SSH and install any software or dependencies required for your project. This might include Git, Node.js, npm, etc., depending on your project's requirements.

3. **Clone the GitHub repository**: Clone the repository containing the Todo List project onto your EC2 instance.

4. **Configure the project**: Follow any setup instructions provided in the project's README file. This might involve configuring environment variables, installing dependencies, setting up a database, etc.

5. **Start the application**: Once everything is set up, start the application according to the instructions provided.

6. **Set up a reverse proxy (optional)**: If your application requires a web server (e.g., Nginx) to handle incoming HTTP requests, set up a reverse proxy to forward requests to your application.

Here's a rough outline of what the commands might look like:

```bash
# Connect to your EC2 instance
ssh -i /path/to/your/key.pem ubuntu@your-ec2-instance-ip

# Install necessary software
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git nodejs npm

# Clone the GitHub repository
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git

# Navigate into the project directory
cd repository

# Follow setup instructions (read README.md)
# For example:
# - Set up environment variables
# - Install dependencies
# - Configure database

# Start the application
npm start

# If using a web server like Nginx, set up a reverse proxy
# Install Nginx
sudo apt install nginx

# Configure Nginx to forward requests to your application
# For example, create a new configuration file in /etc/nginx/sites-available/
# Enable the site and restart Nginx
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/your-site.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Please note that these are general steps, and the specific commands and configurations may vary depending on your project's requirements and the setup instructions provided in its README file. Make sure to read and follow any specific instructions provided by the project.
